  static String aboutBanner = r"""

I'm a Master's student specializing in Cybersecurity, building on a solid foundation in Computer Science and Software Engineering. 

Throughout my studies, I've developed a strong interest in understanding and designing secure systems â€” a field I am eager to continue learning more about!

My coursework has given me the opportunity to explore topics such as penetration testing, digital forensics, vulnerability analysis, and secure software development. 
I'm particularly drawn to answering the questions "How?", "Why?", and "When?", which lie at the heart of these fields.

While I'm still learning new skills and developing as a professional, I aim to bridge the gap between security and the ease of use.
